        <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>My name is Emily Um, I'm 19 years old. I was born and raised in California. I moved to Arizona right after highschool, when I was 17 years old and I currently live with my aunt and her family. I am an only child but I consider my aunt's children my siblings so I am in a way their big sister and baby sitter. </p>

            <p> I would describe myself as a very energetic, fun loving, curious and caring person. At first people may think that I'm very shy and quiet but actually I'm quite the opposite. I love meeting new people, talking to them and building a strong friendship that will I hope last forever. 
                I tend to adjust to my environment very quickly and try my best in all the things that come at me.</p>
